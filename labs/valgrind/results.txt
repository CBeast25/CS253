exp1: delete[] not called

exp2: x[10] to memory outside allocated space, doesn't seg fault b/c the program thinks it is entitled to the memory, delete[] not called 

exp3: x is not initialized if time(nullptr)!=42

exp4: y is uninitialized unless now==0 which isn't possible

exp5: the address can with x[12345678] is outside of the memory the program can use

exp6: delete[] greeting is called before greeting is used

exp7: delete was called on p instead of delete[]

exp8: free() is called instead of delete[]

exp9: a+=3 moves the pointer to an address that does not point to the heap

exp10: an unsigned integer wraps around when it goes into the negative as this is a well defined behavior
